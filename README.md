## How it works?

When you put a date we go back in time and buy some of the Azadi coins with the money you provided. After that, we return to the current day, sell those Azadi coins, and show you the money.

## Our Data

We get our data from excellent [rial-exchange-rates-archive](https://github.com/SamadiPour/rial-exchange-rates-archive) project.
